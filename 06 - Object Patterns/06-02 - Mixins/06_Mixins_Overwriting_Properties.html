<h3>Overwriting Mixin Properties</h3>

<script>

  var person = mixin(new EventTarget(), {

    get name() {         // name is defined as an accessor property with only a getter. The accessor property becomes a data property on the person object.
      return "Garfield"
    },

    sayName: function() {
      console.log(this.name);
      this.fire({ type: "namesaid", name: name});
    }

  });

  console.log(person.name);  // logs "Garfield"

  person.name = "McKinley";  // name is overwritten with a new value.  During the call to mixin(), the value of name is read from the supplier and assigned to the property called name on the receiver.
  console.log(person.name);  // logs "McKinley"
