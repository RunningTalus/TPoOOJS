<h1>Object Patterns</h1>
<h2>Mixins</h2>
<h3>Pseudoinheritance with Mixins</h3>
<p>Mixins - occur when one object acquires properties of another WITHOUT modifying the prototype chain.</p>
<p>The first object a <i>(receiver)</i> receives the properties of the second object the <i>(supplier)</i> by copying those properties directly.</p>
<p>Mixins are shallow copies, so if a property contains an object, then both the supllier and the receiver will be pointing to the same object.</p>
<p>This mixin pattern is used for adding new behaviors to JS objects that already exist on other objects.</p>

<script>

  function mixin(receiver, supplier) {
    for (var property in supplier) {           // for-in loop iterates over the properties in supplier and then assigns the value of the property to a property of the same name on receiver.
      if (supplier.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
        receiver[property] = supplier[property]
      }
    }
    return receiver;
  }
