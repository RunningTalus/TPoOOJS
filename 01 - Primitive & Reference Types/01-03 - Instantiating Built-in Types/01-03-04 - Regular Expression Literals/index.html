<h3>Regular Expression Literals</h3>

  <script>

    var numbers = /\d+/g;
      // Regular Expression Literal looks similar to PERL, pattern contained between two slashes /xxx/ with any
      // additional options added after the second slash.
      // Easier to use, you do not need to escape characters within strings.

    // IS THE SAME AS...

    var numbers = new RegExp("\\d+", "g");
      // RegExp with Constructor, more difficult to use, pattern is passed in as a string, backslashes MUST be escaped.
      // Best use case for using a RegExp constructor, is when the regular expression is being constructed dynamically
      // from two or more strings.
