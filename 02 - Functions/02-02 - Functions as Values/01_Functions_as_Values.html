<h1>Functions</h1>
<h2>Functions as Values</h2>

<p>JavaScript has first-class functions, you can use them just as you do any other objects.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assign them to variables</li>
  <li>Add them to objects</li>
  <li>Pass them to other functions as arguments</li>
  <li>Return them from functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Use functions like any other reference value</p>

<script>

  function sayHi() {      // function declaration for sayHi
    console.log("Hi!");
  }

  sayHi();  // logs "Hi!"

  var sayHi2 = sayHi;     // variable is create and assigned the VALUE of sayHi function

  sayHi2(); // logs "Hi!"


</script>
