<h1>Understanding Objects</h1>
<h2>Types of Properties</h2>
<p><i>Data properties</i> - contain a value.</p>
<p><i>Accessor properties</i> - define a function to call when a property is read (getter), and a function to call when a the property is written to (setter).</p>
<p>NOTE: You don't need to define both a getter and a setter; you can choose one or both. If you define only a getter, then the property becomes read-only, and attempts to write to it will fail silently in nonstrict mode and throw an error in strict mode. If you define only a setter, then the property becomes write-only, and attempts to read the value will fail silently in both strict and nonstrict modes.</p>

  var person1 = {
    _name: "Captain Hook",          // Data Property containing the value "Captain Hook"
                                    // The leading underscore is a common convention to indicate that the property is considered to be private, though in reality it is public.

    get name() {                    // Accessor Property returning a value
      console.log("Reading name");
      return this._name;
    },

    set name(value) {                            // Accessor property that receives the value being assigned to a property as an argument.
      console.log("Setting name to %s", value);
      this._name = value;
    }
  };

  console.log(person1.name);  // logs "Reading name" then "Captain Hook"

  person1.name = "Peter Pan";

  console.log(person1.name);  // logs "Setting name to" then "Peter Pan"
